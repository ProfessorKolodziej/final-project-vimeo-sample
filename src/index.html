		<h1>Welcome to your final project!</h1>
		<p>This is a demo using the Vimeo player SDK. This library allows you to control a Vimeo video using JavaScript.
		</p>
		<p>Check the console of this page using the inspector. You'll see the title of the video. When you play the video,
			a message will log to the console saying the video is playing.</p>
		<p>All code is in js/scripts.js and is based off the <a
				href="https://developer.vimeo.com/player/sdk/basics">Getting Started documentation</a>. To get started with
			controlling the player, try using the <a
				href="https://developer.vimeo.com/player/sdk/reference#about-player-methods">Player Methods
				documentation</a>.</p>
